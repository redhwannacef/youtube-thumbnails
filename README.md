# thumbnails

A small tool built with [Denojs](https://deno.land/) to generate my YouTube thumbnails. This also holds all my YouTube thumbnails in code.

The tool is quite specific to my needs, but can easily be modified to generate any style of thumbnails you want. 
For more, see the YouTube video explaining how it works. //TODO: Add Link
